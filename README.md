This repository provides open access to data analyzed in the article, "The Effects of Voluntary Summer Programs on K-12 Students’ 
Reading and Mathematics Achievement: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."

## Abstract
This review includes 19 studies on the effects of summer intervention programs on reading and mathematics, based on rigorous quality criteria. In reading, there were two types of summer programs: summer school and summer book reading approaches. In mathematics, there was only summer school. The mean effect of summer school programs on reading achievement were positive (mean ES = +0.23, n.s.). However, there were no positive effects, on average, of summer book reading programs (ES=0.00, n.s.). In mathematics, positive effects were also found for summer programs (ES=+0.17, n.s.).
